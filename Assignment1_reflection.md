#Assignment 1: A Personal Inventory Visualized (Reflection)#

Through this project, I realized how my personal belongings shape my emotional landscape and daily interactions. Analyzing the data I collected through these ten meaningful objects helped me recognize the sentimental value I place on things that evoke nostalgia and happiness. 

Many of these items, like my record player from my friends or my Bangalore book of entries, are tied to memories and relationships, reinforcing my deep connection to the past and the people who have influenced me.

A surprising pattern I noticed was how many of my objects are decorative rather than purely functional. While I interact frequently with practical items like my phone or hair clip, many objects simply exist in my space as visual reminders of moments and people. I thought that this suggests that I see my environment as an extension of my identity—curating a space filled with meaning, even if I don’t physically use certain objects often. (Most of my friends have expressed my room to feel more homely than others)

However, I also realized that my relationship with material things has been shaped by my upbringing. I grew up in a household that valued relationships more than possessions, I often wore pre-owned clothes and played with toys passed down from older cousins. I never saw this as a bad thing, and in fact absolutely loved being pampered with these hand-me-downs. Being the youngest cousin on both sides and an only child, I never developed a strong attachment to physical things. 

Moving to NYC reinforced this mindset—I could only bring so much with me, and I’ve only been home twice since. As a result, most of the things I own here have either gained meaning through my experiences in this city or are purely practical.
